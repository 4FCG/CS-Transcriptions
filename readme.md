# What is this?
We want to be able to allow anyone to view and read the [Circle Strafe Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLULV5kBmXoQjg58nznCoQTq9NFGyjxNjr) and learn from them. The problem is that the tutorials not only do not have subtitles, they do not have translations period. So we've decided to add translations and transcriptions of our own for others to read and learn from.
