# Circle Strafe Transcriptions
You are currently reading this in English.

# What is this?
We want to be able to allow anyone to view and read the [Circle Strafe Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLULV5kBmXoQjg58nznCoQTq9NFGyjxNjr) and learn from them. The problem is that the tutorials not only do not have subtitles, they do not have translations period. So we've decided to add translations and transcriptions of our own for others to read and learn from.

# Want to contribute?
1. Go to the *Issues* tab and create a *New Issue* and select one of the templates.
2. Upload the edits to match the names of the tutorial titles **IN ENGLISH.**
3. Simply add the issue and let us take care of the rest.
	- Please do note that if you upload a s\*\*\*post, your Discord account can and will see punishment in the Circle Strafe Discord.
