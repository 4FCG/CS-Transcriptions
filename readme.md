# Circle Strafe Transcriptions
You are currently reading this in English.

# What is this?
We want to be able to allow anyone to view and read the [Circle Strafe Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLULV5kBmXoQjg58nznCoQTq9NFGyjxNjr) and learn from them. The problem is that the tutorials not only do not have subtitles, they do not have translations period. So we've decided to add translations and transcriptions of our own for others to read and learn from.

# The Other Languages
<!--
	Use the following syntax for languages:
		- ABBR: [Language Name](languages/lang/readme.md)
-->
<!--
	Because the tutorials are written in English and the main language of this repository is English, we will simply refer back to the main readme.
	Remember to use relative paths. So for say, Russian:
	- RU: [Russian)](/languages/russian/readme.md)
-->
