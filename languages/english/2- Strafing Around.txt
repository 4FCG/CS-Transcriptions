00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,517
For the viewer. The following is a tutorial for educational purposes.
Remember, information first, music and frags later. I did not come up

2
00:00:05,541 --> 00:00:10,425
with any of this, I am just relaying it the way I think I should. It
contains alot of old footage, but keep in mind the point of this video.

3
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:15,280
I highly reccomend watching in
HD. Adjust your volume and enjoy!

4
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:17,333
Glad to have you back.

5
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:20,173
So for now we are done with
strafing towards.

6
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,167
This uhh, weird strafe.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,243
You know, what would we really, normally,
would consider strafing to be?

8
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:32,275
Well definitely not all of well, this.

9
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:35,607
I mean usually when we hear
the word strafing.

10
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,365
We think about...

11
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:40,725
Two players strafing side to side,
fighting eachother.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,669
Definitely not someone running at you
with the axe and slightly going sideways.

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,519
When a person does this he is
not running after you

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,478
and he is not even strafing at you.

15
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,625
He's just keeping it to himself.

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,152
Keeping a line of fire.

17
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:55,879
Trying to shoot you down.

18
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,802
Usually you'd think that there is no way

19
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:01,322
to stab a person who is doing this.
But..

20
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:06,525
You can stab people who are
strafing around like this

21
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:10,079
So this is the third level of strafing,
strafing around.

22
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,390
There's actually a lot to this level.

23
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,118
It's very familiar at first.

24
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:18,775
But once we get past all of
the obvious stuff.

25
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,158
It actually gets really interesting.

26
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:23,638
So lets get started.

27
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:29,260
Now when a person is strafing around.
In front of you.

28
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,752
He's strafing side to side.

29
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:35,886
You have to identify the two spots,
that he is strafing between.

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,177
And when he's at one spot
and you get close enough.

31
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:43,407
You run over straight to the other spot,
and you intercept him there.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,386
And that's how you get the stab.

33
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,246
Now, it's really simple when you
think about it.

34
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,724
It's all about the prediction,
rather, interception.

35
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:53,664
Let's take a look at a better example.

36
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,339
Going after this spy...

37
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,092
Gunfights with spies.

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,260
He strafes left, he strafes right
and I intercept him.

39
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,373
As he strafes left again.

40
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:08,349
All I have to do is really watch him,
and understand where he is moving.

41
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,292
It's really really simple
when you think about it.

42
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,678
By strafing around,
he leaves you some space.

43
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:18,729
That you can get into
before he gets back into.

44
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:23,794
But what if they strafe,
away from that spot again, in time.

45
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:25,173
Well...

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,413
If it's at the last second kind of thing.

47
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:30,540
You can still get them even though
they are moving away from you.

48
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:32,339
See like here.

49
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,089
Remember you don't have to rush it.

50
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,369
You have the chance to do it as long as
he is still strafing around.

51
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:39,296
You don't wanna risk it being a little off,

52
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:43,022
and having them strafe away from the spot
at the last moment.

53
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,412
I could have also done the stab right here.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,026
And right here.

55
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:51,003
You don't wanna go for this stab like
you go for a normal circle strafe.

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
You wanna run straight and not
turn too soon.

57
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,599
So that you won't get, misled,

58
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,014
by their movements.

59
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,501
Don't rush it.

60
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:01,522
Also to avoid getting shot down.

61
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,468
You wanna really think about it
before just running with the knife.

62
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:08,383
You wanna, use cover and
strafe around a little bit yourself.

63
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:09,975
Before you're getting close.

64
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,955
But typically...

65
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,312
When you use this stab you're already
in a head-on combat scenario.

66
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:18,896
And what you really wanna do
in these situations,

67
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:22,700
is use your gun and shoot,
as you're getting close to them.

68
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,741
Even if you're surprised somehow.

69
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:29,757
You don't wanna just run out in the open
with your knife out at low health,

70
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:33,150
and hope to get a stab because
that's rarely happening.

71
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:37,478
Besides, naturally when people see you
out with the knife for too long,

72
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:40,473
they back away.
Which never ends well for you.

73
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,044
A part of making this stab happen,

74
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:46,036
is having some combat sense.

75
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:48,796
Knowing when people are gonna
just strafe around.

76
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:51,116
And when they're gonna start
backing away from you.

77
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,886
It's knowing how to fight
after your other tricks have failed.

78
00:03:57,231 --> 00:04:01,391
Sometimes it'll be as easy as
he's strafing around in front of you,

79
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,025
All you have to do is stab him

80
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,952
But sometimes you'll have to wait
for a second.

81
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,212
I see this guy he's like,
he's backing off right now.

82
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,554
The moment I see him strafing sideways,

83
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,161
that's where I go for it.

84
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:14,487
Another tip for going about it,
is using leading.

85
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,639
Here I make a slight gesture that I'm going
over to the left side of the hallway.

86
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:23,426
And he flies over there
while I stay on the right.

87
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,782
Leading is a great way to go about
doing the level 3 stab.

88
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:33,351
And doing it in straight hallways like
these can make it even easier for you.

89
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,674
Generally, straight hallways like these
really dictate to people

90
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:42,375
How they should strafe and where they
should back off to.

91
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,365
It makes it really obvious for you, how you
should strafe and where the two spots are.

92
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:50,224
I mean here I just knew it's gonna be the
two sides of that door.

93
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,524
I didn't even have to wait for
him to strafe.

94
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:56,844
Some people are really really dodgy but
once they enter a hallway,

95
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,950
It becomes obvious for you.

96
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,771
There is only your side and his side.

97
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,746
They don't have any other options
for backing up.

98
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:08,883
Sometimes you can lure people into
these kinds of hallways.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,108
To get these easy stabs on them.

100
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,079
When I find myself in a
tight road like this.

101
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,544
Sometimes I just like to run through

102
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,364
and see what happens.

103
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,851
Now...

104
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:25,378
Level three is actually composed of
many successive, normal, sideways strafes.

105
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:28,682
Meaning that the rules of strafing towards
apply to them.

106
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,639
For example he can turn and
look dead traight into your face,

107
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:35,751
but then you have to turn back
because of the adjustments.

108
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:39,061
Remember that the adjustments
could also pull him backwards.

109
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,921
Causing him to get behind you.

110
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:44,738
Although it doesn't happen
nearly as much with level three.

111
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,205
The last strafe of this stab could
also extend into a backpedal stab.

112
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:52,353
The same idea of keeping a line of fire,

113
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:55,205
and keeping you from getting
to the space behind them.

114
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:57,752
Carries on strongly into level three.

115
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,264
The level gravitates mostly backwards,

116
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:04,519
meaning that you won't find many people
running at you side to side like this.

117
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,625
Also the no matadoring them rule,

118
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:10,165
also obviously carries on.

119
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:11,692
Now...

120
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:14,105
When the guy is trafing around.

121
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,305
When he reaches either spot.

122
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:20,779
He can choose to stop strafing around
and to start strafing backwards.

123
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,838
If he feels like you got too close.

124
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:26,435
Now, why is it only on the edge
of the strafe that they can back off?

125
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,271
Well that's because
people are already strafing

126
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,670
as fast as they
possibly can against you.

127
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,231
They're not suddly
capable of breaking the

128
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,946
strafe sooner just because
you got close to them.

129
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:41,375
That's why if you're faster you
can itercept their sideways strafe.

130
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,362
And stab them like that.

131
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:45,591
Now...

132
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:49,959
If you happen to mispredict the
timing to go for a spot or if you

133
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:54,356
choose the wrong spot you're going
to horribly horribly get shot down.

134
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,922
Your chances of getting a stab after that,

135
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,182
are pretty much up to luck,

136
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:02,274
or coincidences with angles.

137
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:06,860
Definitely not getting the backpedal
stab normally, after mispredicting.

138
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:10,647
Now, speaking of predictions
and strafing speeds.

139
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:15,820
There are people who have very long strafes
like these, which are easy to predict.

140
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:20,846
But some people in comparison
have much smaller and faster strafes.

141
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:23,820
And the thing about
people with faster strafes is

142
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,552
that because they can
back off at the edge of the

143
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:29,451
strafe and they're getting
to the edges a lot more

144
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:32,349
than normally they have
more chances of backing off.

145
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:35,580
Meaning that they're very
good at getting away from you.

146
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:38,136
So at first I thought,
well if they're doing

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,887
it faster all I need to
do is do it faster too.

148
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,061
Like more surprising, more edgy.

149
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:46,844
But I found that there is a
special little trick that you

150
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:50,544
can add to your stab for
people who are strafing faster.

151
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:53,152
So lets take a look at this situation.

152
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:57,896
Now if I've learned anything from
anything then I know what to do

153
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,836
But then again.

154
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,576
Maybe I don't.

155
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:07,424
The thing about people with
fast strafes is that they manage

156
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:10,879
to get in one more strafe
than what you'd usually predict.

157
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,160
Usually I'd jump over this
pumpkin and go for that

158
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:17,374
left spot but before I
noticed that he was strafing

159
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:20,397
really fast and I knew
that he'd manage to get

160
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,420
one more strafe in
before I get to where he is.

161
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:26,432
Usually even by intuition
you'd go for the free

162
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,323
spot that he leaves you,
from a certain distance.

163
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,328
But for people who
have fast strafes you have

164
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:35,657
to aim to go to that spot
where he's already at.

165
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,592
Lets take a look at this.

166
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,253
It would be a sin at this distance
to not go for that free spot.

167
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:46,225
But I fought this guy before
and I got that close even at this

168
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:50,110
distance I could not intercept
him correctly I could not get him.

169
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,505
So I know that even if it's that
obvious I shouldn't go for that spot.

170
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,733
I should go for the other one.

171
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,342
The thing just goes
against your basic instinct.

172
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:05,132
So the stab just gets
tweaked a little, you need

173
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,743
to train yourself to
run straight at the guy.

174
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:10,367
Predicting that he would strafe twice.

175
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,574
Once away from you and once
back into where you're going.

176
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:17,199
The more you'll do it you'll get used to
the idea of running straight at him,

177
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,779
like so. But...

178
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,143
If the guy is strafing left and
right very fast and you're running

179
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,471
straight at him there is a very
big chance that you'll get confused.

180
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,834
But the more you do it
the more you get used

181
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,896
to the idea that you're
running at a spot.

182
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,223
And not at him.

183
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,003
So even if you get confused, if
you end up there then it's still ok.

184
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:41,181
Some people try to mislead
you on purpose while doing this.

185
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,311
We're gonna get to those
guys later though, I promise.

186
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,725
But uhh...

187
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,933
Back to people with fast strafes.

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,013
Again they're very good at
getting away from you so...

189
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,036
You don't necessarily want
to take them head-on like this.

190
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:57,982
If it's possible try to jump
straight for the backpedal stab.

191
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:03,132
People who are strafing around, do it
from the moment they face you and onwards.

192
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:06,030
But if they never face
you they never start

193
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:09,482
strafing and you can get
them with simpler stabs.
