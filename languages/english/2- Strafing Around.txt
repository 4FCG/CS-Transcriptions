00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,517
For the viewer. The following is a tutorial for educational purposes.
Remember, information first, music and frags later. I did not come up

2
00:00:05,541 --> 00:00:10,425
with any of this, I am just relaying it the way I think I should. It
contains a lot of old footage, but keep in mind the point of this video.

3
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:15,280
I highly recommend watching in
HD. Adjust your volume and enjoy!

4
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:17,333
Glad to have you back.

5
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:20,173
So for now we are done with
strafing towards.

6
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,167
This uhh, weird strafe.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,243
You know, what would we really, normally,
would consider strafing to be?

8
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:32,275
Well definitely not all of well, this.

9
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:35,607
I mean usually when we hear
the word strafing.

10
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,365
We think about...

11
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:40,725
Two players strafing side to side,
fighting each other.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,669
Definitely not someone running at you
with the axe and slightly going sideways.

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,519
When a person does this he is
not running after you

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,478
and he is not even strafing at you.

15
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,625
He's just keeping it to himself.

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,152
Keeping a line of fire.

17
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:55,879
Trying to shoot you down.

18
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,802
Usually you'd think that there is no way

19
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:01,322
to stab a person who is doing this.
But..

20
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:06,525
You can stab people who are
strafing around like this

21
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:10,079
So this is the third level of strafing,
strafing around.

22
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,390
There's actually a lot to this level.

23
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,118
It's very familiar at first.

24
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:18,775
But once we get past all of
the obvious stuff.

25
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,158
It actually gets really interesting.

26
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:23,638
So lets get started.

27
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:29,260
Now when a person is strafing around.
In front of you.

28
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,752
He's strafing side to side.

29
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:35,886
You have to identify the two spots,
that he is strafing between.

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,177
And when he's at one spot
and you get close enough.

31
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:43,407
You run over straight to the other spot,
and you intercept him there.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,386
And that's how you get the stab.

33
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,246
Now, it's really simple when you
think about it.

34
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,724
It's all about the prediction,
rather, interception.

35
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:53,664
Let's take a look at a better example.

36
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,339
Going after this spy...

37
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,092
Gunfights with spies.

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,260
He strafes left, he strafes right
and I intercept him.

39
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,373
As he strafes left again.

40
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:08,349
All I have to do is really watch him,
and understand where he is moving.

41
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,292
It's really really simple
when you think about it.

42
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,678
By strafing around,
he leaves you some space.

43
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:18,729
That you can get into
before he gets back into.

44
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:23,794
But what if they strafe,
away from that spot again, in time.

45
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:25,173
Well...

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,413
If it's at the last second kind of thing.

47
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:30,540
You can still get them even though
they are moving away from you.

48
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:32,339
See like here.

49
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,089
Remember you don't have to rush it.

50
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,369
You have the chance to do it as long as
he is still strafing around.

51
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:39,296
You don't wanna risk it being a little off,

52
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:43,022
and having them strafe away from the spot
at the last moment.

53
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,412
I could have also done the stab right here.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,026
And right here.

55
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:51,003
You don't wanna go for this stab like
you go for a normal circle strafe.

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
You wanna run straight and not
turn too soon.

57
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,599
So that you won't get, misled,

58
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,014
by their movements.

59
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,501
Don't rush it.

60
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:01,522
Also to avoid getting shot down.

61
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,468
You wanna really think about it
before just running with the knife.

62
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:08,383
You wanna, use cover and
strafe around a little bit yourself.

63
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:09,975
Before you're getting close.

64
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,955
But typically...

65
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,312
When you use this stab you're already
in a head-on combat scenario.

66
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:18,896
And what you really wanna do
in these situations,

67
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:22,700
is use your gun and shoot,
as you're getting close to them.

68
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,741
Even if you're surprised somehow.

69
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:29,757
You don't wanna just run out in the open
with your knife out at low health,

70
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:33,150
and hope to get a stab because
that's rarely happening.

71
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:37,478
Besides, naturally when people see you
out with the knife for too long,

72
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:40,473
they back away.
Which never ends well for you.

73
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,044
A part of making this stab happen,

74
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:46,036
is having some combat sense.

75
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:48,796
Knowing when people are gonna
just strafe around.

76
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:51,116
And when they're gonna start
backing away from you.

77
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,886
It's knowing how to fight
after your other tricks have failed.

78
00:03:57,231 --> 00:04:01,391
Sometimes it'll be as easy as
he's strafing around in front of you,

79
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,025
All you have to do is stab him

80
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,952
But sometimes you'll have to wait
for a second.

81
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,212
I see this guy he's like,
he's backing off right now.

82
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,554
The moment I see him strafing sideways,

83
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,161
that's where I go for it.

84
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:14,487
Another tip for going about it,
is using leading.

85
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,639
Here I make a slight gesture that I'm going
over to the left side of the hallway.

86
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:23,426
And he flies over there
while I stay on the right.

87
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,782
Leading is a great way to go about
doing the level 3 stab.

88
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:33,351
And doing it in straight hallways like
these can make it even easier for you.

89
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,674
Generally, straight hallways like these
really dictate to people

90
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:42,375
How they should strafe and where they
should back off to.

91
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,365
It makes it really obvious for you, how you
should strafe and where the two spots are.

92
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:50,224
I mean here I just knew it's gonna be the
two sides of that door.

93
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,524
I didn't even have to wait for
him to strafe.

94
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:56,844
Some people are really really dodgy but
once they enter a hallway,

95
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,950
It becomes obvious for you.

96
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,771
There is only your side and his side.

97
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,746
They don't have any other options
for backing up.

98
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:08,883
Sometimes you can lure people into
these kinds of hallways.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,108
To get these easy stabs on them.

100
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,079
When I find myself in a
tight road like this.

101
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,544
Sometimes I just like to run through

102
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,364
and see what happens.

103
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,851
Now...

104
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:25,378
Level three is actually composed of
many successive, normal, sideways strafes.

105
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:28,682
Meaning that the rules of strafing towards
apply to them.

106
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,639
For example he can turn and
look dead straight into your face,

107
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:35,751
but then you have to turn back
because of the adjustments.

108
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:39,061
Remember that the adjustments
could also pull him backwards.

109
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,921
Causing him to get behind you.

110
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:44,738
Although it doesn't happen
nearly as much with level three.

111
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,205
The last strafe of this stab could
also extend into a backpedal stab.

112
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:52,353
The same idea of keeping a line of fire,

113
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:55,205
and keeping you from getting
to the space behind them.

114
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:57,752
Carries on strongly into level three.

115
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,264
The level gravitates mostly backwards,

116
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:04,519
meaning that you won't find many people
running at you side to side like this.

117
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,625
Also the no matadoring them rule,

118
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:10,165
also obviously carries on.

119
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:11,692
Now...

120
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:14,105
When the guy is strafing around.

121
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,305
When he reaches either spot.

122
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:20,779
He can choose to stop strafing around
and to start strafing backwards.

123
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,838
If he feels like you got too close.

124
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:26,435
Now, why is it only on the edge
of the strafe that they can back off?

125
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,271
Well that's because
people are already strafing

126
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,670
as fast as they
possibly can against you.

127
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,231
They're not suddenly
capable of breaking the

128
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,946
strafe sooner just because
you got close to them.

129
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:41,375
That's why if you're faster you
can intercept their sideways strafe.

130
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,362
And stab them like that.

131
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:45,591
Now...

132
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:49,959
If you happen to mispredict the
timing to go for a spot or if you

133
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:54,356
choose the wrong spot you're going
to horribly horribly get shot down.

134
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,922
Your chances of getting a stab after that,

135
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,182
are pretty much up to luck,

136
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:02,274
or coincidences with angles.

137
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:06,860
Definitely not getting the backpedal
stab normally, after mispredicting.

138
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:10,647
Now, speaking of predictions
and strafing speeds.

139
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:15,820
There are people who have very long strafes
like these, which are easy to predict.

140
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:20,846
But some people in comparison
have much smaller and faster strafes.

141
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:23,820
And the thing about
people with faster strafes is

142
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,552
that because they can
back off at the edge of the

143
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:29,451
strafe and they're getting
to the edges a lot more

144
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:32,349
than normally they have
more chances of backing off.

145
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:35,580
Meaning that they're very
good at getting away from you.

146
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:38,136
So at first I thought,
well if they're doing

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,887
it faster all I need to
do is do it faster too.

148
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,061
Like more surprising, more edgy.

149
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:46,844
But I found that there is a
special little trick that you

150
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:50,544
can add to your stab for
people who are strafing faster.

151
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:53,152
So lets take a look at this situation.

152
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:57,896
Now if I've learned anything from
anything then I know what to do

153
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,836
But then again.

154
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,576
Maybe I don't.

155
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:07,424
The thing about people with
fast strafes is that they manage

156
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:10,879
to get in one more strafe
than what you'd usually predict.

157
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,160
Usually I'd jump over this
pumpkin and go for that

158
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:17,374
left spot but before I
noticed that he was strafing

159
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:20,397
really fast and I knew
that he'd manage to get

160
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,420
one more strafe in
before I get to where he is.

161
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:26,432
Usually even by intuition
you'd go for the free

162
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,323
spot that he leaves you,
from a certain distance.

163
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,328
But for people who
have fast strafes you have

164
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:35,657
to aim to go to that spot
where he's already at.

165
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,592
Lets take a look at this.

166
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,253
It would be a sin at this distance
to not go for that free spot.

167
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:46,225
But I fought this guy before
and I got that close even at this

168
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:50,110
distance I could not intercept
him correctly I could not get him.

169
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,505
So I know that even if it's that
obvious I shouldn't go for that spot.

170
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,733
I should go for the other one.

171
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,342
The thing just goes
against your basic instinct.

172
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:05,132
So the stab just gets
tweaked a little, you need

173
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,743
to train yourself to
run straight at the guy.

174
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:10,367
Predicting that he would strafe twice.

175
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,574
Once away from you and once
back into where you're going.

176
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:17,199
The more you'll do it you'll get used to
the idea of running straight at him,

177
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,779
like so. But...

178
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,143
If the guy is strafing left and
right very fast and you're running

179
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,471
straight at him there is a very
big chance that you'll get confused.

180
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,834
But the more you do it
the more you get used

181
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,896
to the idea that you're
running at a spot.

182
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,223
And not at him.

183
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,003
So even if you get confused, if
you end up there then it's still OK.

184
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:41,181
Some people try to mislead
you on purpose while doing this.

185
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,311
We're gonna get to those
guys later though, I promise.

186
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,725
But uhh...

187
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,933
Back to people with fast strafes.

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,013
Again they're very good at
getting away from you so...

189
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,036
You don't necessarily want
to take them head-on like this.

190
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:57,982
If it's possible try to jump
straight for the backpedal stab.

191
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:03,132
People who are strafing around, do it
from the moment they face you and onwards.

192
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:06,030
But if they never face
you they never start

193
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:09,482
strafing and you can get
them with simpler stabs.

194
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:13,641
Now, if you go for a level
three stab and they back

195
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,780
away from you, then
they're out of your reach.

196
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,505
So you don't wanna deal with that.

197
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:21,591
You wanna somehow start up-close to them.

198
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:26,961
To go for a backpedal first and then
if that fails, you go for a level three.

199
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,329
So you wanna go
for the stab when he is

200
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:32,819
chasing you from behind
or something like that.

201
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,849
Be if he is already strafing around
he is not gonna stop, look at this guy.

202
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:41,563
He just got away from me too. It's
hard to predict his two spots so...

203
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,997
c2c is a great option.

204
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,343
To jump straight for the backpedal.

205
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,233
c2c is a great answer
for level three in general.

206
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,957
Whether the guy doesn't even come near
the corner or is strafing on the corner.

207
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,220
Meaning that...

208
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:00,333
He can stay that far behind the corner.

209
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,584
Like that soldier.
And you'd still get him.

210
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,691
I hope you still remember how this,

211
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:08,371
take the inside of a corner thing
works because it could not get any

212
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:12,465
easier for you to get people who
are strafing around in the corner with it.

213
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,701
You don't have to predict the spots
and you don't have to do anything.

214
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:19,593
They will see you running at them
and they'll back up into the corner.

215
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:22,865
Look at this guy he is strafing all around.

216
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:25,118
Then I get close and he backs up,

217
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:27,056
into that turn.

218
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,533
His movements become steadier
because its obvious for him,

219
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,093
What he should do.

220
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,909
And that makes it easier for us too.

221
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,077
Whether they're strafing
around or strafing around and

222
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,939
then backing off, or just
backing off normally. Or just...

223
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,431
Staying way behind the corner, strafing.

224
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:46,778
This is your answer.

225
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,827
But uhh. All c2c's aside.

226
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:52,301
If you know that there's a turn coming up.

227
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,735
Try to put yourself in-between,

228
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,442
him and that turn.

229
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:59,725
Like here, I try to block
him from going into spawn.

230
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,012
He doesn't do it, but
its just a precaution.

231
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,462
But now OK...

232
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,656
These guys are really dodgy.

233
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,530
And c2c isn't always an option.

234
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,518
And you obviously still want
to go for a backpedal first.

235
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,035
So you need a way to trap them.

236
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:19,355
You wanna stop their level three.

237
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,401
So how about this.

238
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:24,373
Obviously they don't have
much room to work with when

239
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:27,113
they're trapped between
you and a wall like this.

240
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,685
So their next sideways strafe
gets forced into a backwards strafe.

241
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:35,144
Also their adjustments get locked forwards.

242
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:38,976
And at that point they're
completely trapped with 0 options.

243
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:43,164
Now you can attempt for this to
happen anywhere if there's a wall.

244
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,490
It doesn't have to be that enclosed off.

245
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,302
So here's how it's done.

246
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,809
As he's strafing left and right,

247
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:52,365
and as he's heading towards the wall.

248
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:58,040
You strafe with him and you let him get
to your side and to the wall before you do.

249
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,846
Now you're wondering
why I'm turning so late,

250
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:03,066
for the stab in these examples.

251
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,122
The thing is you gotta keep
pushing him towards the wall,

252
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:11,700
to make sure there's absolutely no
space for him to strafe away from you with.

253
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:17,819
See here I turned immediately and he got an
extra strafe, an extra step away from me.

254
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,893
And towards the wall,
which caused me to fail.

255
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:24,654
In order to make sure they're
trapped you have to keep pressing

256
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,246
against them until you feel
them trying to push against you.

257
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,883
Then, you turn for the stab.

258
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:34,781
Eventually you learn
to do this on the outside.

259
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:39,968
Only, it doesn't trap them as much. But
it is much better than doing it normally.

260
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,175
This works wonders against players
who manage to pull a backwards

261
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,110
strafe at the last moment there
or manage to turn the strafe.

262
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:50,548
Just run trough their middle, pressing your
side against them if only for a second.

263
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,368
Locking their view ahead
and not letting him turn.

264
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,066
Trapping him, in the backpedal stab.

265
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:01,586
But keep in mind, this is just scraping
the surface of the glue stab really.

266
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:04,818
This stab is actually really
important for you to remember,

267
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:07,565
for future videos as well as this one.

268
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,326
But for now that's enough about that.

269
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:11,892
Now...

270
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:14,868
Some people are capable
of strafing even faster.

271
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,534
To the point where it
gets ridiculous really.

272
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:21,602
Like with this guy and this next
guy the same thing happens.

273
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:22,941
Both of them,

274
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:27,531
were capable of putting three
strafes, more than the fast strafes,

275
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:32,071
in the distance where I'd usually predict
that they could only put in one strafe.

276
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,939
Meaning that I went for the
free spot and I still got them.

277
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:38,341
Although they were strafing really fast.

278
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:41,129
Now there are kind of
speeds that you can't even

279
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:43,807
really predict anymore
when you're facing them.

280
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:48,434
And its this kind of ridiculous
speed that I define as juking.

281
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,922
Some people are
strafing so fast they're not

282
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:54,467
even moving, I mean
look at my two spots here.

283
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,338
And look how easily he got away from me.

284
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,231
People who are juking like this are
impossible to predict with the two spots.

285
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,274
Every slightly longer move
they'll make will throw you off.

286
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:10,044
So you can just bet on one
side and hope for the best.

287
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,461
But with only that much
nothing will happen.

288
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:16,604
Just remember that whenever
you're fighting a person who's juking.

289
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:19,588
The game hates you, the
game just fucking hates you.

290
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:22,434
Too intense, too fast, too quick.

291
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:27,020
But because juking is such
an intense form of movement.

292
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,991
It needs something
to support itself with.

293
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:32,081
For example this guy.

294
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:37,143
He was juking which forced him
to stay way on the left over there.

295
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,936
And then to actually
get me in front of him,

296
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,097
he had to take a very
long strafe to the right.

297
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,909
Now, I can use this
information to my advantage.

298
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:51,242
I know that he jukes
around on the left.

299
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,589
But eventually he's gonna have
a slightly longer strafe to the right.

300
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,476
This guy's the same.

301
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:01,632
While I'm strafing around in front of
him I try to stay a little bit to his left,

302
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,909
because I notice that he's juking,

303
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:08,983
and that he has a slightly longer
strafe to the left every time he shoots.

304
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:12,944
It's not like I'm just strafing straight
over to that spot, I need to keep

305
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:18,793
him juking normally so that I could
eventually exploit this support of his.

306
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,399
Now, that guy's also juking.

307
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,032
But the way he's going
about it is different.

308
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,932
Rather than a longer strafe
he aims with the mouse.

309
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,846
Meaning that if I get
close enough, I could get

310
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:34,086
one of those circle
strafe-ish stabs on him.

311
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,607
That's something that
could also happen when

312
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,961
people are trying to juke
at you with their melee.

313
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:41,710
Often it will end with a matador.

314
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:45,296
But really, it's something that
changes from player to player.

315
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,964
Some people stand still and
then juke just for a second,

316
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,644
to support themselves.

317
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:54,287
It's up to you to understand what
they're doing to support themselves,

318
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,875
and find a way to
exploit it for yourself.

319
00:16:57,062 --> 00:17:00,109
But typically you can't
handle the jukes so try to jump

320
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:03,647
straight to the backpedal
stab, don't let him start juking.

321
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,839
Head-on with this guy, try to
predict a kind of long strafe,

322
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,159
Bah...

323
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,989
And that's it, I can't, I
can't get close to him.

324
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,624
But I can get him if I trap him,

325
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,771
in the backpedal stab. Here
I also trap him on the wall.

326
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:19,692
It's preventing him from juking.

327
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:22,048
But remember, it's not one
of those strafing backwards

328
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:25,112
stabs. He's not strafing
sideways and backwards into you.

329
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,929
That's not happening,
he has to be trapped.

330
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:31,609
And I can't stress
this enough, use c2c.

331
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:35,801
Skip the jukes, go straight
for the backpedal stab.

332
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:37,523
Easy.

333
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,079
See a guy juking there at that corner?

334
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:41,793
You know what to do.

335
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:47,651
But with all seriousness, if it's not
enclosed enough they could get away.

336
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:51,099
So when you're head on
like this, you could use glue.

337
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:54,638
Instead of running to one of
their sides, run to their middle.

338
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:56,588
And try to get it.

339
00:17:57,214 --> 00:18:00,382
Ideally enough you
wanna, strafe to his side

340
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,820
in the right moment
and just get him like that.

341
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:05,432
You wanna be able to look and see,

342
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,918
how the guy's supporting
himself while juking. This guy is...

343
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:11,412
gesturing over there to the left.

344
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,536
So I strafe over to his left for the stab.

345
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:19,333
Or like this guy, he starts juking
at the edge of longer strafes.

346
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,851
Goes to the left he jukes, he goes to
the right he jukes, goes to the left,

347
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:24,644
with a long strafe again.

348
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,324
You wanna see that.

349
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,293
You wanna be able to understand
what's happening, as it's happening.

350
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,207
And try to work from there, but...

351
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:35,921
No matter how you do it
by trying to strafe to his side,

352
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:38,359
a person who is juking
has any number of

353
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,913
opportunities to start
backing away from you so...

354
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:44,433
what you actually wanna
do is to try to run to his middle.

355
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:45,806
You wanna try glue.

356
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:49,767
You wanna try giving him no
options other than to back off.

357
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,734
To trap him in the backpedal stab.

358
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:54,241
That's the best way, to go about it.

359
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,734
So that's it about juking.

360
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:01,146
Generally speaking,

361
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,532
a lot of people start strafing around,

362
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:06,778
when they are fighting but
it's definitely not everyone.

363
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:11,430
Lets take a look at this guy,
just predict two spots and get him.

364
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,976
But...

365
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:17,653
He wasn't on level three and he wasn't
strafing around, it wasn't like that.

366
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,576
He went behind a corner and jumped back.

367
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,683
Now he has to strafe towards me like this.

368
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,043
Then like that.

369
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,210
And then eventually strafe
backwards as I get closer, here.

370
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:33,296
Now how do I know this?
And why the hell is this important?

371
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:36,166
I mean I stabbed him right?
That's what's important.

372
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:41,354
But no. It's true that sometimes the level
one stab can look like a level three stab.

373
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:44,043
But it's important to
understand that earlier he

374
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,578
wasn't strafing around
he wasn't doing anything,

375
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:51,911
near that. And had I known this at the time
I would have been able to stab him sooner.

376
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:56,065
These two levels can be very similar
and they can sometimes overlap.

377
00:19:56,271 --> 00:20:00,824
Was it like that? Or was it like that? I
don't know. And I'm not gonna know,

378
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:04,963
until I see this guy again and
figure out exactly what he's doing.

379
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,953
It can get really confusing
if you're leading the guy.

380
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:12,838
Or if it's a stab on a person with
fast strafes it can also look like leading.

381
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,872
And you can get confused.

382
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:18,165
But it's important to understand
what the guy typically does.

383
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:20,035
Not how you stabbed
him that one time.

384
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,419
You need to know how to
face him for the next times.

385
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:27,991
On a finishing note here
let's discuss some overhead and,

386
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,532
underhead angles, for level three.

387
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,147
When you're stationary on a prop,

388
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:36,381
a person who's going to be
strafing around in front of it.

389
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:39,257
If you're in the middle of
a chase then you can jump,

390
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,949
for the jump stab and
have it be very surprising.

391
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:43,542
But when you're gun fighting,

392
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:45,752
and strafing around on the prop yourself.

393
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,292
There is no need to jump.

394
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:50,729
You can predict the two spots
and it will be a lot safer for you,

395
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,215
and a lot faster too.

396
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,409
Not giving him time to react.

397
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:58,573
So if you're on something and
you don't have to jump, don't do it.

398
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:01,996
The only reason I'd find for jumping,

399
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:04,362
while fighting someone
head-on like this,

400
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:06,364
for the level three stab is...

401
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:10,867
When you feel like something will
block you from getting them normally.

402
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,617
Here the wall to the right is blocking
me as he opens up the space, to go there.

403
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,650
So I just jump.

404
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,787
Instead of strafing normally
and having the wall block me.

405
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:25,969
And finally, as for
understabs for level three.

406
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,870
The only thing I can really think
about is uhh, something like this.

407
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,416
But uhh yeah let
me know, I guess.

408
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,361
So well guys, we've reached another
ending that's not really an ending.

409
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,833
We've covered a lot of stuff in this video.

410
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,686
But in the grand scheme of things,
we're not even half way there yet.

411
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:51,260
Up till now it was just the beginning.
We've only scraped the surface.

412
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:54,599
In the next part we'll
really start diving in there.

413
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:56,599
So I want you to take a breather,

414
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,525
and I want you to click the next video.

415
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,786
So I'll see you then.
